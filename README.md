The project is aimed at creating an application to gauge the safety index of an area in a particular city.
It has been designed to benefit women in India by giving them real time information about any place in their city.

Tweets are streamed into the system using the Twitter streaming API and analysed. We have come up with a ranking mecahnism to rank all the tweets based on their accuracy and authenticity while also keeping in mind the recency of events.

The app receives real time information through a server which does all the analysis of tweets and news articles corresponding to the region requested by the user. The server stores the Safety Index in a MySQL DB and the app can request the information when required. 

This project is still under development and we plan to add more features in the days to come.
